## How Does It Work?

### Server-Side Song Download ðŸ’¾  

1. An **asynchronous function** is started, and the track/video ID is added to a set of currently downloading items.
2. If a **track ID** is provided, metadata is fetched from the **Spotify API** to determine the corresponding YouTube video ID.
3. A YouTube video URL is constructed:  
   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={yt_vid}`  
   and a temporary file path is prepared.
4. Both the URL and the file path are passed to **`yt-dlp`**, which downloads the audio.
5. Upon successful download, the **audio duration** is determined using `ffprobe` (required for iOS and macOS native audio players).
6. A **SHA-512 hash** is computed from the audio to check for duplicates in the database:
   - If the audio already exists, nothing is added, and temporary files are deleted.
   - If it's new, both the duration and audio file are inserted into the database before cleanup.
7. Finally, the track/video ID is removed from the set of currently downloading items.


### Audio Playback Flow ðŸŽµ  

1. The user starts by searching for a song.
2. When the desired track is tapped, a WebSocket connection is opened to the serverâ€™s `/test` endpoint.
3. The server checks if the track already exists in the database:
   - If it **does**, the server responds with `{"exists": "true"}` and the connection is closed.
   - If it **does not**, the server responds with `{"exists": "false"}` and the client waits while the song is downloaded.
4. Once the song becomes available, the server sends `{"exists": "true"}` to notify the client.
5. The selected track is then prepared locally on the user's device and passed to the native audio player.
6. The native audio player sends a request to the serverâ€™s `/play_song` endpoint, which responds with the audio stream.

### Mix Mode ðŸ”€  

1. **Enable Mix Mode** in the app's preferences.
2. When a **single track** (not part of a playlist or album) is played, the standard [Audio Playback Flow](#-audio-playback-flow) is triggered.
3. After the track finishes, a WebSocket request is sent to:  
   `/cfc14e13ca191618a06bd94dd5976fccae585e36b3f651b467947288afb51ea8`
4. The server uses the track ID to fetch metadata from the **Spotify API**.
5. A search query is generated in the format:  
   `"<track name> - <artist 1>, <artist 2>, ..."`
6. This query is sent to YouTube's search endpoint. First valid **video ID** is extracted.
7. The video ID is used to retrieve the corresponding **YouTube Mix playlist ID**.
8. A YouTube URL is constructed:  
   `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={yt_vid}&list={mix_id}&index=1`
9. This URL is passed to `yt-dlp`, which downloads the **first 20 songs** in the mix.
10. As each song is downloaded, the server sends metadata back to the client, which adds the track to the playback queue under **Mix #N**.
